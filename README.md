# Creating a RESTful API 

This project is almost a template for an API where users can manage a database of documents using HTTP 'commands' such as GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH
requests. These requests can be for *all* articles/documents, or for single articles/documents.

The example here uses the `app.route(...)` 'chaining' for more streamlined code.
